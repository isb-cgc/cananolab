 * This <code>Authentication Manager</code> interface provides all the
 * authentication methods and services offered by the Common Security Module.
 * This interface defines the contract that any class which wants to acts as an
 * authentication manager should follow to be able to fit in the Common Security
 * Framework. It defines the methods which are required for the purpose of
 * authenticating a user against the configured credential providers. This
 * interface by default is implemented by the {@link gov.nih.nci.security.authentication.CommonAuthenticationManager}. 
 * If the client application wants to use its own Authentication Class, then it should implement the
 * <code>AuthenticationManager</code> interface. Also an entry should be configured
 * in the <code>ApplicationServiceConfig</code> file against the Application
 * Context Name regsitering the class, which it wants to use, as shown below
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *		&lt;application&gt;
 *	   		&lt;context-name&gt;
 *	   			FooApplication
 *	      	&lt;/context-name&gt;
 *	      	&lt;authentication&gt;
 *		      	&lt;authentication-provider-class&gt;
 *	     			com.Foo.AuthenticationManagerClass
 *	     		&lt;/authentication-provider-class&gt;
 *			&lt;/authentication&gt;
 *			:
 *			:
 *		&lt;/application&gt;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * 
 * If you want to use the default implementation provided by CSM, then with version 3.2 you dont need to specify 
 * an entry in the <code>ApplicationSecurityConfig</code> file.
 * 
 * If the client application wants to use just the authentication service then it can
 * obtain the implementation of the <code>AuthenticationManager</code> interface from the 
 * {@link SecurityServiceProvider} class.
