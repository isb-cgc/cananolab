 * This factory class instantiates and returns the appropriate implementation of the {@link AuthenticationManager}
 * interface. This class reads the <code>Authentication.Properties</code> file to determine which implementation of the
 * <code>AuthenticationManager</code> is to be used. If the client application wants to use its own
 * Authentication Class, then it should implement the {@link AuthenticationManager} interface. Also an entry should be configured
 * in the <code>ApplicationSecurityConfig</code> file against the Application
 * Context Name registering the class, which it wants to use, as shown below
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>

 *
 * However, if no entry is found for the application in the <code>ApplicationSecurityConfig.xml</code> file, then the default
 * implementation is used. The factory instantiate an instance of the {@link CommonAuthenticationManager} class and returns it
 * type casted as an object of <code>AuthenticationManager</code> interface.
 *
 * If the client application wants to use just the authentication service then it can
 * obtain the implementation of the <code>AuthenticationManager</code> interface from the
 * {@link SecurityServiceProvider} class.
